# Testing of forms: 

* I wrote a few simple forms https://tarasovartem.github.io/Sample_Test_Cases_for_a_Login/ (HTML/CSS) for testing. In the future, I plan to add few forms and a functional part on  JavaScript/Typescript plus some framework.

* Intro:
1. Writing a test plan.
2. Writing test cases.
3. Manual testing (description of the process).
4. Writing tests with frameworks such as cypress, webdriver.io etc. (Typescript, Javascript)
5. Unit tests: Jest (?)


# Tests with the Cypress framework can be seen in my repository:
