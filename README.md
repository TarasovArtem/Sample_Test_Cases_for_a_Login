# Testing of the login form: 

* I wrote a simple login form (HTML/CSS) for testing. In the future, I plan to add a functional part in JavaScript.

* Testing:
1. Writing a test strategy.
2. Writing test cases.
3. Manual testing (description of the process).
4. Testing using frameworks like cypress, webdriver.io etc. (Typescript, Javascript)
5. Unit tests: Jest (?)


# Tests with the Cypress framework can be seen in my repository:
